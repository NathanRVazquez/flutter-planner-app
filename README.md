# Flutter Planner App

## Getting started

To run the app you can either download the apk to your andorid mobile device or download this repository and run the app on your PC.

To download the APK, use this link to sign up for the app distribution, https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/6e546163d4a6d0ec. Once you enter your email and accept the invitation you will get an email to download the app. Follow the instructions in the invitation email to allow your phone to download the app. Feel free to email me if you have any questions.

To run the app on your pc, clone this repo. Then navigate to the "release" branch. Use andorid studio to run an android phone emulator and then run the app using VS Code or Android Studio.
